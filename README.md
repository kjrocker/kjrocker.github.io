# My Personal Site

This site has been through a lot. At one point, it was about 14 lines of HTML and CSS.

Then it was written in _Haskell_.

Then it was written mostly in Nunjucks, and somehow that was harder to read than the Haskell.

Now it's written in Astro.

But I don't think the whole site has ever weighed more than a few hundred kilobytes. Not in the last 5 years anyway.

I usually rewrite it either as a framework-learning exercise, or because I don't want to stare at an _old_ framework-learning exercise anymore.
