      Welcome welcome, come on in, pull up a seat. You've found my site, a love
      letter to an older internet that I barely remember. Before Javascript,
      before everything was flooded with ads and flashy graphics, we had text.

      Mostly this is where I think about Postgres. One day I'll write about
      something else, but for now, it's Postgres. I do have other interests, I
      promise.

      I build sites, not quite as minimal as this one, for small businesses as
      well.
