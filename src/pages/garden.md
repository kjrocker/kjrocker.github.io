<section class="prose md:prose-sm dark:prose-invert prose-stone">

A digital garden is a collection of thoughts, ideas, and resources that grow over time. Organized by topic instead of chronologically, it's a fun log of all the interesting things I've found and read. Here's what I'm currently tending to:

## Programming Resources

- [The 'Awesome' Network](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - The ultimate, open sourced, collaborative collection of awesome links.
- [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) in general, and [Designing for Crisis](https://medium.com/net-magazine/designing-for-crisis-9cab10b4c519) in particular.

## Books

- [The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month) - A timeless text, as insightful now as when it was published in 1975.
- [How To Read a Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book) - Probably the oldest text on this list, this 1940 guide is exactly what it says on the tin. A must-read for anyone who wants to get more out of their reading.
- [The Story of Art, E.H. Gombrich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art?ref=nav_sb_noss_l_12) - A must-read for anyone looking for an accessible introduction to art and art history. Informative and unpretentious.
- [The Way The World Really Works, Vaclav Smil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56587388-how-the-world-really-works) - Smil is probably Bill Gate's favorite author. He's clear-sighted, numbers-driven, and seemingly immune to hype.

## Interesting Reads

- [Sodas Are No Longer Free](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/) - A story of penny-wise, pound-foolish leadership.
- [Lucidity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/) - An uncompromisingly honest take on software and software development.
- [Motherfucking Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) - "All the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves."
- [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/) - A simple exercise in humility, and something I think about all the time.
- [Databases Are Just Files. Postgres Too.](https://tselai.com/all-databases-are-just-files) - Demystifying some Postgres fundamentals.
- [Life Altering Postgres Patterns](https://mccue.dev/pages/3-11-25-life-altering-postgresql-patterns) - Some simple but helpful tips and tricks, implemented in pure SQL.
- [LLMs can't stop making up software dependencies](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/12/ai_code_suggestions_sabotage_supply_chain/) - A reminder that LLMs are text prediction tools, and their mistakes have consequences.
