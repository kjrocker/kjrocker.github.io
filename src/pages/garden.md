<section class="prose md:prose-sm dark:prose-invert prose-stone">

A digital garden is a collection of thoughts, ideas, and resources that grow over time. Organized by topic instead of chronologically, it's a fun log of all the interesting things I've found and read. Here's what I'm currently tending to:

## Programming Resources

- [The 'Awesome' Network](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - The ultimate, open sourced, collaborative collection of awesome links.

## Interesting Reads

- [Sodas Are No Longer Free](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/) - A story of penny-wise, pound-foolish leadership.
- [Lucidity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/) - An uncompromisingly honest take on software and software development.
- [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/) - A simple exercise in humility, and something I think about all the time.

*This garden is constantly growing. Check back often for new additions!*
