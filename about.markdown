title: About
---

I'm a professional software developer and as of 2021 a digital nomad. I specialize in Typescript, SQL, and functional programming. When I'm not working I'm out taking photos, playing Factorio, learning Japanese, or just going on long walks in the city.

_There is an idea of a Kevin Rocker, some kind of abstraction. And though you can see my GitHub commits and hear the tenor of my voice, and you probably sense that we have much in common, I simply am not there..._
